## Projects:
### Tridibot
The first big project I worked on was Tridibot, an open source 3D printed robot created for educational purposes. 
My role was to write the code to control the robot (Arduino) and the web interface to control it (HTML CSS JS).

### Henry Fitness
A WebApp created for the Bootcamp SoyHenry.

This App seeks to improve the online interaction that a gym has with its customers. Providing all the information about the services it offers, giving the facility to pay memberships online and manage your calendar or classes.

Technologies:
Back-End: Express Sequelize NodeJS 
Database: PostgreSQL
Front-End: React Redux css html Bootstrap 

The backend of the project is deployed in #Heroku and the frontend in #Vercel

Carrying out this project was a very big challenge and finishing it successfully was only possible thanks to the amazing team I had.
